This repository was built to store the source codes created on the data science processes, in addition to presenting any questions to be answered in each analysis process and the results obtained.

## Directory Structure :rocket:

- **coursera:** place where the scripts built in the Coursera Data Science course are stored.
- **projects:** place where the source codes of the personal Data Science projects created are stored.
- **training:** location where .ipynb notebooks are stored containing tests or brief tutorials on any tool used in the data science process.
